				<h2 class="sub-heading">Hello there ðŸ‘‹, Iâ€™m Tarek.</h2>
				<p>
					As a Front-End and Full-Stack Developer, I have experience with a wide
					range of web development technologies, including Node.JS, ReactJS,
					Vue.JS, and more. I've been involved with company/team sizes that use
					AGILE/SCRUM methodologies to deliver high quality software projects on
					time and within budget.
				</p>
				<p>
					In addition to my technical skills, I have a strong attention to
					detail and a passion for creating intuitive and responsive user
					interfaces. I take pride in writing clean, maintainable, and scalable
					code that is easily understood and modified by other developers.
				</p>

				<p>
					I am comfortable working both independently and collaboratively, and
					have excellent communication skills that allow me to work effectively
					with stakeholders, designers, and other developers. Whether it's
					building a brand new application from scratch or adding new features
					to an existing one, I am always eager to take on new challenges and
					push the boundaries of what's possible.
